# Smart-Platform
IoT app designed for automation and remote control of an industrial small platform powered by a dual axis solar traker system.

The project aims to develop a prototype for an energy-autonomous mobile system that can support the movement of industrial 
robots that perform tasks in the open field and continually moving. The system comes with a dual-axis solar tracking system, 
the project also pursuing an analysis of the efficiency of such a real-time solar energy capture method. To all this, there 
is an Android platform for manual and automated control based on Cloud and IoT services. Both the platform and the control 
application are called SmartPlatform. The platform also has useful sensors to avoid obstacles. 
The SmartPlatform application allows remote control with your own Android device in areas with Internet connection, giving 
the user both manual and automated control, with the option of creating repetitive driving cycles on user-defined routes.
