# Smart-Platform

IoT app designed for automation and remote control of an industrial mini-platform powered by a dual axis solar traker system.

       The project aims to develop a prototype for an energy-autonomous mobile system that can support the movement 
    of industrial robots while performing tasks in the open field and continually moving. 
       The system comes with useful sensors to avoid obstacles and a dual-axis solar tracking system for power
    supply. An analysis in regards the efficiency of such a real-time solar traking device was elaborated in 
    the documentation.
       For manual and automated control there is an Android platform based on Cloud and IoT services. Both the 
    platform and the control application are called SmartPlatform. 
       The SmartPlatform application allows remote control with your own Android device in areas with Internet 
    connection, giving the user both manual and automated control, with the option of creating repetitive driving 
    cycles on user-defined routes.
